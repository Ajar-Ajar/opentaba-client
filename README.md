[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/niryariv/opentaba-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/niryariv/opentaba-client)Client code for OpenTaba - details will arrive soon, but the code is pretty simple to understand.If you came looking for the server side of opentaba It's [here](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server).##Testingsee [what's needed](tests/testing.md) with testing.##Production###ArchitectureThe production environment is made up of a github pages site and a reverse proxy redirecting connectionsfrom multiple subdomains to the site (as github pages don't support more than one domain/subdomain).All unique municipality settings are read from [munis.js](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-client/blob/master/munis.js), and the gush map is loaded from [the israel_gushim repository](https://github.com/niryariv/israel_gushim/) (unless overridden in munis.js)###MaintenanceMaintenance is done using [fabric](http://fabfile.org), by activating different tasks defined in fabfile.py (for a list of all tasks, run `fab -l`, and for details about a specific task run `fab -d <task-name>`)To execute a task, run: `fab task-name:arg1,arg2...` or `fab task-name:arg1=val1,arg2=val2...`Notice that the fab files only exist in [opentaba-server](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server) to keep them together.For step-by-step instructions on how to add a new municipality, check out [opentaba-server's Deployment Readme](http://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md#deploy-a-new-municipality)For information about the municipality index file's syntax, check out [The Deployment Readme](DEPLOYMENT.md)The only client task is add_muni (muni_name, display_name='') which adds all the necessary data to munis.js to create a "new site" for the municipality, or updates an existing one.##Want to help?look at the issues.
